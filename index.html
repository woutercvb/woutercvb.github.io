    			<details><summary><i>Abstract</i></summary><p class="indetails">
				List colouring is an influential and classic topic in graph theory. We initiate the study of a natural strengthening of this problem, where instead of one list-colouring, we seek many in parallel.
				Our explorations have uncovered a potentially rich seam of interesting problems spanning chromatic graph theory.
				Given a $k$-list-assignment $L$ of a graph $G$, which is the assignment of a list $L(v)$ of $k$ colours to each vertex $v\in V(G)$, we study the existence of $k$ pairwise-disjoint proper colourings of $G$ using colours from these lists. 
				We may refer to this as a <i>list-packing</i>. Correspondingly, we define the <i>list-packing number</i> of $G$ as the smallest $k$ for which a list-packing is guaranteed to exist for every $k$-list-assignment of $G$.
				<br/><br/>
				Using a mix of combinatorial and probabilistic methods, with a central role for random binary matrices, we set out some basic upper bounds on the list-packing number, in terms of the number of vertices, the degeneracy, the maximum degree, or the (list) chromatic number of $G$. 
				We also pursue a more focused study of the case when $G$ is a bipartite graph.
				<br/><br/> 
 				Our results do not yet rule out the tantalising prospect that the list-packing number is uniformly bounded by a constant multiple of the list chromatic number.
				<br/><br/>
				 Our study has taken inspiration from study of the strong chromatic number, and we also explore generalisations of the problem above in the same spirit, such as a packing variant of the <i>correspondence chromatic number</i>. 
				For instance, we find that the correspondence packing number (and hence the list-packing number) of a bipartite graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is at most $(1+o(1)) \Delta/\log \Delta$, which is sharp up to a factor at most two.

				We wish to bring attention to a natural but slightly hidden problem, posed by Erdős and Nešetřil. in the late 1980s, an edge version of the degree-diameter problem. Our main result is that, for any graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ with more than $1.5\Delta^t$ edges, its line graph must have diameter larger than $t$. In the case where the graph contains no cycle of length $2t+1$, we can improve the bound on the number of edges to one that is exact for $t \in \left\{1,2,3,4,6\right\}$. In the case $\Delta=3$ and $t=3$, we obtain an exact bound. Our results also have implications for the related problem of bounding the distance-$t$ chromatic index, $t>2$; in particular, for this we obtain an upper bound of $1.941 \Delta^t$ for graphs of large enough maximum degree $\Delta$, markedly improving upon earlier bounds for this parameter.

    			<details><summary><i>Abstract</i></summary><p class="indetails">
				We prove that every connected cubic graph with $n$ vertices has a maximal matching of size at most $\frac{5}{12} n+ \frac{1}{2}$. This confirms the cubic case of a conjecture of Baste, F&uuml;rst, Henning, Mohr and Rautenbach (2019) on regular graphs. More generally, we prove that every graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges and maximum degree at most $3$ has a maximal matching of size at most $\frac{4n-m}{6}+ \frac{1}{2}$. These bounds are attained by the graph $K_{3,3}$, but asymptotically there may still be some room for improvement. Moreover, the claimed maximal matchings can be found efficiently. As a corollary, we have a $\left(\frac{25}{18} + O \left( \frac{1}{n}\right)\right) $-approximation algorithm for minimum maximal matching in connected cubic graphs.

    			<details><summary><i>Abstract</i></summary><p class="indetails">
				We investigate the effect of a fixed forbidden clique minor upon the strong chromatic index, both in multigraphs and in simple graphs. We conjecture for each $k\ge 4$ that any $K_k$-minor-free multigraph of maximum degree $\Delta$ has strong chromatic index at most $\frac32(k-2)\Delta$. We present a construction certifying that if true the conjecture is asymptotically sharp as $\Delta\to\infty$. In support of the conjecture, we show it in the case $k=4$ and prove the statement for strong clique number in place of strong chromatic index. By contrast, we make a basic observation that for $K_k$-minor-free simple graphs, the problem of strong edge-colouring is ``between'' Hadwiger's Conjecture and its fractional relaxation. We also treat $K_k$-minor-free multigraphs of edge-diameter at most $2$.

				Motivated by a conjecture of the first author, we prove that every properly coloured triangle-free graph of chromatic number $\chi$ contains a rainbow independent set of size $\lceil\frac12\chi\rceil$. This is sharp up to a factor $2$. This result and its short proof have implications for the related notion of chromatic discrepancy.
				Drawing inspiration from both structural and extremal graph theory, we conjecture that every triangle-free graph of chromatic number $\chi$ contains an induced cycle of length $\Omega(\chi\log\chi)$ as $\chi\to\infty$. Even if we only asked for an induced path of length $\Omega(\chi\log\chi)$, the conclusion would be sharp up to a constant multiple. We prove it for regular girth $5$ graphs and for girth $21$ graphs. As a common strengthening of the induced paths form of this conjecture and of Johansson's theorem (1996), we posit the existence of some $c>0$ such that for every forest $H$ on $D$ vertices, every triangle-free and induced H-free graph has chromatic number at most $\frac{cD}{\log D}$. We prove this assertion with <i>triangle-free</i> replaced by <i>regular girth $5$</i>.

				We prove that for every integer $t\ge 1$ there exists a constant $c_t$ such that for every $K_t$-minor-free graph $G$ and every set $S$ of balls in $G$, the minimum size of a set of vertices of $G$ intersecting all the balls of $S$ is at most $c_t$ times the maximum number of vertex-disjoint balls in $S$. This was conjectured by Chepoi, Estellon, and Vax&egrave;s in 2007 in the special case of planar graphs and of balls having the same radius.

    			<details><summary><i>Abstract</i></summary><p class="indetails">
				A classic theorem of Erd&#x0151s and P&oacute;sa (1965) states that every graph has either $k$ vertex-disjoint cycles or a set of $O(k \log k)$ vertices meeting all its cycles. 
				While the standard proof revolves around finding a large `frame' in the graph (a subdivision of a large cubic graph), an alternative way of proving this theorem is to use a ball packing argument of K&uuml;hn and Osthus (2003) and Diestel and Rempel (2005). In this paper, we argue that the latter approach is particularly well suited for studying edge variants of the Erd&#x0151s-P&oacute;sa theorem. <br/><br/> As an illustration, we give a short proof of a theorem of Bruhn, Heinlein, and Joos (2019), that cycles of length at least $\ell$ have the so-called edge-Erd&#x0151s-P&oacute;sa property. More precisely, we show that every graph $G$ either contains $k$ edge-disjoint cycles of length at least $\ell$ or an edge set $F$ of size $O(k\ell \cdot \log (k\ell))$ such that $G-F$ has no cycle of length at least $\ell$. For fixed $\ell$, this improves on the previously best known bound of $O(k^2 \log k +k\ell)$.

    			<details><summary><i>Abstract</i></summary><p class="indetails">
				Every $n$-vertex planar triangle-free graph with maximum degree at most $3$ has an independent set of size at least $\frac{3}{8}n$. This was first conjectured by Albertson, Bollob\'as and Tucker, and was later proved by Heckman and Thomas. Fraughnaugh and Locke conjectured that the planarity requirement could be relaxed into just forbidding a few specific nonplanar subgraphs: They described a family $\mathcal{F}$ of six nonplanar graphs (each of order at most $22$) and conjectured that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph with maximum degree at most $3$ having no subgraph isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{F}$ has an independent set of size at least $\frac{3}{8}n$. <br/><br/>In this paper, we prove this conjecture. As a corollary, we obtain that every $2$-connected $n$-vertex triangle-free graph with maximum degree at most $3$ has an independent set of size at least $\frac{3}{8}n$, with the exception of the six graphs in $\mathcal{F}$. 
				This confirms a conjecture made independently by Bajnok and Brinkmann, and by Fraughnaugh and Locke.

				We prove that any triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $d$ contains a bipartite induced subgraph of minimum degree at least $d^2/(2n)$. This is sharp up to a logarithmic factor in $n$. Relatedly, we show that the fractional chromatic number of any such triangle-free graph is at most the minimum of $n/d$ and $(2+o(1))\sqrt{n/\log n}$ as $n\to\infty$. This is sharp up to constant factors. Similarly, we show that the list chromatic number of any such triangle-free graph is at most $O(\min\{\sqrt{n},(n\log n)/d\})$ as $n\to\infty$. <br/> <br/>Relatedly, we also make two conjectures. First, any triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices has fractional chromatic number at most $(\sqrt{2}+o(1))\sqrt{n/\log n}$ as $n\to\infty$. Second, any triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices has list chromatic number at most $O(\sqrt{n/\log n})$ as $n\to\infty$.

				Given a graph $G$, the <i>strong clique number</i> $\omega_2'(G)$ of $G$ is the cardinality of a largest collection of edges every pair of which are incident or connected by an edge in $G$. We study the strong clique number of graphs missing some set of cycle lengths. For a graph $G$ of large enough maximum degree $\Delta$, we show among other results the following:
				<br/><br/>$\omega_2'(G)\le5\Delta^2/4$ if $G$ is triangle-free; <br/>$\omega_2'(G)\le3(\Delta-1)$ if $G$ is $C_4$-free; <br/>$\omega_2'(G)\le\Delta^2$ if $G$ is $C_{2k+1}$-free for some $k\ge 2$. <br/><br/> These bounds are attained by natural extremal examples. Our work extends and improves upon previous work of Faudree, Gy\'arf\'as, Schelp and Tuza (1990), Mahdian (2000) and Faron and Postle (2019). We are motivated by the corresponding problems for the strong chromatic index.

				Let $H$ be a planar graph. By a classical result of Robertson and Seymour, there is a function $f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and all graphs $G$, either $G$ contains $k$ vertex-disjoint subgraphs each containing $H$ as a minor, or there is a subset $X$ of at most $f(k)$ vertices such that $G-X$ has no $H$-minor.
				We prove that this remains true with $f(k) = c k \log k$ for some constant $c=c(H)$. This bound is best possible, up to the value of $c$, and improves upon a recent result of Chekuri and Chuzhoy (STOC 2013), who established this with $f(k) = c k \log^d k$ for some universal constant $d$. The proof is constructive and yields a polynomial-time $O(\log \text{opt})$-approximation algorithm for packing subgraphs containing an $H$-minor.

    			<details><summary><i>Abstract</i></summary><p class="indetails">
				Let $G$ be a claw-free graph on $n$ vertices with clique number $\omega$, and consider the chromatic number $\chi(G^2)$ of the square $G^2$ of $G$. Writing $\chi_s^{'}(d)$ for the supremum of $\chi(L^2)$ over the line graphs $L$ of simple graphs of maximum degree at most $d$, we prove that $\chi(G^2) \leq \chi_s^{'}(\omega)$ for $\omega \in \left\{3,4\right\}$. For $\omega=3$, this implies the sharp bound $\chi(G^2) \leq 10$. For $\omega=4$, this implies $\chi(G^2) \leq 22$, which is within $2$ of the conjectured best bound. This work is motivated by a strengthened form of a conjecture of Erdős and Nešetřil.

				Two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ on $n$ vertices are said to <i>pack</i> if there exist injective mappings of their vertex sets into $[n]$ such that the images of their edge sets are disjoint. A longstanding conjecture due to Bollob\'as and Eldridge and, independently, Catlin, asserts that, if $(\Delta(G_1)+1) (\Delta(G_2)+1) \le n+1$, then $G_1$ and $G_2$ pack. We consider the validity of this assertion under the additional assumption that $G_1$ or $G_2$ has bounded codegree. In particular, we prove for all $t \ge 2$ that, if $G_1$ contains no copy of the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,t}$ and $\Delta(G_1) > 17  t \cdot \Delta(G_2)$, then $(\Delta(G_1)+1) (\Delta(G_2)+1) \le n+1$ implies that $G_1$ and $G_2$ pack. We also provide a mild improvement if moreover $G_2$ contains no copy of the complete tripartite graph $K_{1,1,s}$, $s\ge 1$.

				A Jordan region is a subset of the plane that is homeomorphic to a closed disk. Consider a family $\mathcal{F}$ of Jordan regions whose interiors are pairwise disjoint, and such that any two Jordan regions intersect in at most one point. If any point of the plane is contained in at most $k$ elements of $\mathcal{F}$ (with $k$ sufficiently large), then we show that the elements of $\mathcal{F}$ can be colored with at most $k+1$ colors so that intersecting Jordan regions are assigned distinct colors. This is best possible and answers a question raised by Reed and Shepherd in $1996$. As a simple corollary, we also obtain a positive answer to a problem of Hliněný ($1998$) on the chromatic number of contact systems of strings. We also investigate the chromatic number of families of touching Jordan curves. This can be used to bound the ratio between the maximum number of vertex-disjoint directed cycles in a planar digraph, and its fractional counterpart.

		<li> <i><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03727.pdf">Esperet-Kang-Thomass&eacute;-conjecture</a> (2018)</i>. Let G be a triangle-free graph on n vertices with minimum degree d. Does G have an induced bipartite subgraph of order Omega(log d)? The conjecture holds for regular graphs by the Johansson-Molloy theorem. Moreover, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02512"> it is known that</a> G has an induced bipartite subgraph of minimum degree d^2/(2n), which is even polynomial in d if d>n^(1/2+epsilon). Thus it suffices to prove the conjecture for graphs with d << (n*log(n))^(1/2). </li>
		<li> <i>Strong immersion conjecture (1989, 2003)</i>. Is the chromatic number of a graph G bounded from above by its (strong) immersion number i(G)? Two known upper bounds are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08235">3.54 i(G)+4</a> and <a href="https://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/548169/thesis_wouter_cames_van_batenburg.pdf">(i(G)+delta(G))/2</a>, rounded upwards. Here delta(G) denotes the degeneracy of G. </li>
		<li> <i>Erdos-Nesetril-conjecture (~1988)</i>. Let G be a graph with maximum degree Delta. Is it true that the (fractional) chromatic number of the square of the line graph of G is at most 5/4*Delta^2? Is it at most Delta^2 if G is bipartite? </li>
		<li> <i>BEC-conjecture (1976)</i>. Let G1 and G2 be two graphs on n vertices with maximum degrees Delta1 and Delta2, respectively. Show that G1 and G2 <i>pack</i> if (Delta1+1)(Delta2+1) <= n+1. </li>

		<li> <i>Nontrivial percolation threshold.</i> Given a graph G with isoperimetric dimension strictly larger than 1, does it hold that the percolation threshold of G is strictly less than 1? This question traces back to the paper <a href="http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ecp/1453756499"> Percolation Beyond Z^d, Many Questions And a Few Answers</a>. </li> 

		<li> <i>Variance in Last Passage Percolation.</i> Put iid random weights on each vertex of Z^2. Consider oriented (North-East) paths of length n that start in (0,0). The <i> weight </i> of a path is the sum of the weights of the vertices that are visited by the path. The <i> heaviest path</i> is the path with the largest weight, among all paths of length n. Does it hold that the variance of the weight of the heaviest path is asymptotically equal to a constant multiple of n^{2/3}, as n goes to infinity? This (and more) is known to be true if the distribution of the vertex weights is either an exponential or a geometric distribution, but it is expected to hold for a much wider class of distributions. In general, roughly, the variance is only known to be between log(n) and n/log(n). See <a href="http://math.northwestern.edu/~auffing/FPPSurvey.pdf">this survey </a> for more details.</li>
		<li> <i>Hard squares constant. </i> Let N and n be positive integers. Consider the set A(n,N) of all 0,1-words of length n for which there are no pairs of 1's that are adjacent or at distance exactly N. Find a nice exact expression for \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} |A(n,N)|^{1/n}. This limit exists and it is equal to the so-called Hard squares constant, of which many digits are semi-rigorously known. Equivalently, this problem asks to asymptotically count the number of stable sets in a large gridgraph. </li>
